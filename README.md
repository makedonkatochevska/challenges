## Project Description 📜

The **Day Planner Application** is a simple web-based tool designed to help users organize their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add tasks along with the time they need to be completed. The application highlights tasks that are due today and ensures persistence using **local storage**.

### Key Features:

- Users can input a **task name**, **task time**, and **task date**.
- Displays the **current date** at the top of the page.
- Alerts users if they try to add a task without all required fields.
- Allows users to **remove tasks** from the list.
- Highlights tasks that are scheduled for the current day.
- Saves tasks to **local storage** to persist across page refreshes.

This challenge focuses on **JavaScript objects, event handling, local storage, and dynamic UI updates**.
