## Exercise 1: Chunk Array 📜

### Project Description

This exercise involves writing a JavaScript function that takes an array and a chunk size as input and returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array has a length equal to the chunk size.

### Instructions

1. Write a function `chunkArray` that accepts an array and a chunk size as arguments.
2. The function should return a new array, where each sub-array has a length equal to the chunk size.
3. If there are any remaining elements that don't form a full chunk, they should be included in the final sub-array.

## Exercise 2: Queue Implementation 🔑

### Project Description

In this exercise, you will implement a queue using an array. You will create functions to add an item to the queue and to remove an item from the queue.

### Instructions

1. Implement a queue using an array.
2. Create an `enqueue(item)` function that adds an item to the queue (using `push()`).
3. Create a `dequeue()` function that removes the first item from the queue (using `shift()`).
4. Test the queue by adding and removing items.

## Exercise 3: Prime Number Checker 🔲

### Project Description

This exercise requires creating a JavaScript program that iterates through an array of different numbers and checks if each number is prime. The program should then print an array with the results of these checks.

### Instructions

1. Write a function that iterates through an array of numbers and checks if each number is prime.
2. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that can only be divided (without a remainder) by 1 and itself.
3. Create a helper function `isPrime(num)` that checks if a number is prime.
4. Return an array of boolean values indicating whether each number is prime.

## Usage 🚀

Once you have the project set up locally, follow these steps to interact with the exercises:

1. **Exercise 1: Chunk Array**:

   - Open the `exercise1.html` file in your browser.
   - The array will be split into chunks of the specified size and displayed in the output.

2. **Exercise 2: Queue Implementation**:

   - Open the `exercise2.html` file in your browser.
   - The queue operations will be tested by adding and removing items from the queue. The result will be displayed in the console.

3. **Exercise 3: Prime Number Checker**:

   - Open the `exercise3.html` file in your browser.
   - The program will check each number in the array to see if it's prime and display the results as an array of booleans.
