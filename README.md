## Exercise 1: Array Transformation 📜

### Project Description

This exercise involves writing a JavaScript function that takes an array of numbers and transforms it as follows:

- If a number is less than 10, multiply it by 2.
- If a number is 10 or greater, multiply it by 4.

### Instructions

1. Write a function `transformArray` that accepts an array of numbers.
2. For each number, check if it is less than 10 or greater than or equal to 10, and apply the corresponding transformation.
3. Return the transformed array.

## Exercise 2: Password Checker 🔑

### Project Description

This exercise involves creating a password validation system. The password must meet specific conditions:

- It should be at least 8 characters long.
- It should contain at least one number.
- It should contain at least one uppercase letter.

### Instructions

1. Prompt the user to enter a password.
2. Check if the password meets the following criteria:
   - If the password is shorter than 8 characters, show an error message.
   - If the password does not contain a number or an uppercase letter, show an error message.
   - If the password is valid, show a success message.

## Exercise 3: Dynamic Table Generator 🔲

### Project Description

This exercise involves creating a dynamic HTML table based on user input for the number of rows and columns.

### Instructions

1. Prompt the user to enter the number of rows and columns for the table.
2. Create a function `generateTable` that dynamically generates a table.
3. The header cells (`th`) should display "Header" followed by the column number.
4. The data cells (`td`) should display "Row" followed by the row number, and "Col" followed by the column number.

## Usage 🚀

Once you have the project set up locally, follow these steps to interact with the exercises:

1. **Exercise 1: Array Transformation**:

   - Open the `exercise1.html` file in your browser.
   - The array of numbers will be processed based on the transformation rules:
     - Numbers less than 10 will be multiplied by 2.
     - Numbers 10 or greater will be multiplied by 4.
   - The transformed array will be displayed in the output.

2. **Exercise 2: Password Checker**:

   - Open the `exercise2.html` file in your browser.
   - Enter a password when prompted.
   - The system will validate the password based on the following criteria:
     - It must be at least 8 characters long.
     - It must contain at least one number and one uppercase letter.
   - If the password is valid, a success message will appear. If it's invalid, an error message will be displayed.

3. **Exercise 3: Dynamic Table Generator**:
   - Open the `exercise3.html` file in your browser.
   - Enter the number of rows and columns for the table.
   - The program will generate a dynamic table with the specified number of rows and columns:
     - The header cells will display "Header" followed by the column number.
     - The body cells will display "Row" followed by the row number and "Col" followed by the column number.
