## Project Description 📜

**Magnetic Gallery Website** is a visually appealing gallery landing page designed to showcase images in an organized and interactive layout. The layout is structured using HTML and SCSS, with a fixed sidebar navigation, header, and footer, while the right side of the page remains scrollable. The navigation items and gallery items feature smooth hover effects to create an engaging user experience. SCSS is utilized for its powerful features like mixins, extends, and variables to keep the styling efficient and maintainable. This project is fully responsive, ensuring that the design adapts to various devices from desktops to mobile screens.

## Project Purpose 📖

The **Magnetic Gallery Website** was built as a demonstration of my skills in creating responsive layouts using SCSS, along with interactive hover effects for a modern and dynamic user interface. The primary goal of the project is to showcase a gallery with smooth transitions and hover animations, while ensuring a user-friendly navigation experience. By leveraging SCSS features such as mixins, extends, and variables, the code is optimized and scalable. The use of SCSS ensures that the design is both functional and easy to maintain, with organized and modular CSS architecture.
