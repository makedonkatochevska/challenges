## Project Description 📜

The **Weather Dashboard** is a simple web application that allows users to search for a city and display its current weather conditions along with a simulated 5-day forecast. The application uses an **array of objects** as a mock database to fetch weather data. Additionally, recent searches are stored in **local storage** for quick access.

### Key Features:

- Users can search for a city to get its current weather conditions.
- A simulated 5-day weather forecast is generated.
- Recent searches are saved in local storage.
- Users can click on a recent search to re-run a query for that city.
- Dynamic UI updates to display weather data in an organized manner.

This challenge focuses on **JavaScript objects, event handling, local storage, and dynamic UI updates**.
