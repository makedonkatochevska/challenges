# Weekly Front-End Challenges

Welcome to my repository for the **weekly challenges** at **Brainster Front-End Academy**! Each week, we are tasked with a new challenge that helps us sharpen our coding skills and apply the concepts learned during the course.

### Challenge Format:

- **Frequency**: One challenge every week.
- **Duration**: We have **7 days** to complete each challenge.
- **Progression**: The difficulty of the challenges increases over time, starting with simpler tasks and gradually advancing to more complex ones.

The challenges are designed to build our skills progressively, from mastering basic HTML and CSS to diving deeper into Bootstrap, JavaScript, React, and other advanced front-end technologies. With each passing week, we face new problems that push us to think critically and improve our ability to write clean, efficient code.

### What Youâ€™ll Find in This Repo:

- **Main Branch**: Overview and general information about the challenges.
- **Individual Challenge Branches**: Each branch corresponds to a specific week's challenge. Explore them to see how we tackle different front-end tasks each week.

These challenges are a great way to test your skills, experiment with new ideas, and see your progress as a front-end developer. Check out the branches to see how the challenges escalate and the skills i develop each week!
