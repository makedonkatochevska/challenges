## Project Description 📜

This project involves creating a personalized study timer that allows users to set up study sessions with breaks. The application visually represents the session progress using a dynamic progress bar. Users can input their preferred study and break durations, which are saved and persisted using local storage.

### Key Features:

- Users can input and save their study and break durations.
- The study and break durations persist in local storage upon refresh.
- A dynamic progress bar visually represents the time left for each session.
- JavaScript timers (`setTimeout` and `setInterval`) manage the countdown for study and break periods.
- Notifications alert the session is over.
- A session log displays completed study sessions and break durations.

This challenge focuses on working with JavaScript event listeners, local storage, timers, and dynamic UI behavior.
