## Exercise 1: IPv4 Address Validator 📜

### Project Description

This exercise involves writing a JavaScript function that checks if a given string satisfies the rules of a valid IPv4 address.

### Instructions

1. Write a function `isIPv4Address(inputString)` that takes a string as input.
2. The function should return `true` if the input string is a valid IPv4 address, and `false` otherwise.
3. An IPv4 address is a string with four numbers, each in the range from 0 to 255, separated by dots (`.`).
4. If any of the numbers is out of the range or contains non-numeric characters, return `false`.

2. The function should return a new matrix with a border of asterisks around it.
3. The border should completely surround the picture, with `*` placed at the first and last rows and columns.
