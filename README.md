## Exercise 1: Leap Year Checker 📜

### Project Description

This JavaScript exercise prompts the user to enter a year and checks if it is a **leap year** or **not** based on the leap year rules:

- A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4.
- However, if the year is also divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is divisible by 400.

### Instructions

1. Prompt the user to enter a year (number).
2. Check if the year is a leap year.
3. If the year is a leap year, the message "The year is a leap year" pops up in **green** color.
4. If the year is not a leap year, the message "The year is not a leap year" pops us in **red** color.
5. If the entered value is not correct(not a valid year), an alert window pops up.

2. Check the grade and determine if it falls within specific ranges:
   - A: 90-100 (green color)
   - B: 80-89 (blue color)
   - C: 70-79 (yellow color)
   - D: 60-69 (orange color)
