## Project Description 📜

**Challenge1** is a simple landing page. This project was developed entirely with **CSS positioning**, demonstrating proficiency in traditional CSS layout techniques such as absolute, relative, and fixed positioning.

---

## Project Purpose 📖

The **Challenge1** landing page is created to showcase my skills in CSS, particularly using positioning for layout. The project emphasizes the use of positioning techniques like `position: absolute`, `position: relative`, and `position: fixed` for designing an engaging and visually appealing page without relying on modern layout methods like Flexbox or Grid.

---

## Features ✨

- 🎨 **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed only for desktop devices.
- 📚 **Hero Section**: A hero section with a background image, styled with absolute positioning to place the text on top.
- 📝 **Contact Form**: A contact form that is positioned correctly using relative and absolute positions.
- 🧑‍💼 **Fixed Footer**: The footer is fixed at the bottom of the page, remaining in place as users scroll.
