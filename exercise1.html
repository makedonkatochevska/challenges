      // A leap year is a year that is divisible by 4 except for end-of-century years, which must be divisible by 400. This means:
      //    ● Every year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
      //    ● However, if the year can also be divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless...
      //    ● The year is also divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

      // Prompt the user to enter a year (number). Save this year in a variable and check if the year entered is a leap year or not:
      //  a. If the year is a leap year, create a paragraph with JavaScript and attach to this paragraph the message: “The year is a leap year”. Make the color of the text in the paragraph green.
      //   b. Otherwise, create a paragraph with JavaScript and attach to this paragraph the message: “The year is a leap year”. Make the color of the text in the paragraph red

      //user prompt
      const yearEntered = Number(prompt("Enter a year."));

      //html paragraph
      const p = document.createElement("p");
      document.body.appendChild(p);

      //check if it's a leap year
      if (!!yearEntered === false || yearEntered < 0) {
        alert("Please enter a valid year!");

        yearEntered % 4 === 0 &&
        (yearEntered % 100 !== 0 || yearEntered % 400 === 0)
      ) {
        p.innerText = `The year ${yearEntered} is a leap year.`;
        p.style.color = "green";
