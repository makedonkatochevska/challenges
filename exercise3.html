      //Create a JavaScript program that iterates in an array of different numbers and checks if the number is prime or not.
      //Print on the console an array with the result of these checks.
      //Create a function that iterates through the array of numbers and another function that checks if the number is prime or not.
      //Remember, a prime number is a number greater than 1 that can only be divided (without a remainder) by 1 and itself.
      //Example: const numbers = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10;
      //Result: [true, true, false, true, false, true, false, false, false];

      //Fnc to check if the number is prime or not
      const isItPrimeNum = function (number) {
        //checks if the number is greater than 1
        if (number <= 1) {
          return false;

        //checks if it's divisible only by 1 and itself
